# Enigma
Enigma Machine with Eclipse
This is my personal project to create an Enigma machine to deepen my understanding of how enigma machines worked
I designed this machine to be able to take user input for how many rotors of the machine they would like to use for their encryption/decryption, then asking the user for a message
The program accounts for punctuations and upper/lowercase lettering
